# BANK-LOAN-DASHBOARD
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover key insights related to loan performance, risk assessment, and customer repayment behavior. Using Power BI, raw loan records were transformed into interactive dashboards that help understand trends in loan disbursement, repayment status, and default risk.
